We all love Pokémon. Dont we?
In this project I have used pokeapi to import information about all the pokémons.
Basic structure is created with HTML
Designs and features are added through CSS
With JS the api is fetched and information about all the pokémons is displayed.

**This is a free-to-use project I made while making front projects with APIs**
